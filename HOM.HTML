	<p><b><font color="BLUE" size="5"> <i>Plants</i> </font></b><font size="4"> fall under the kingdom of plants, multicellular organisms, and the presence of plants is very important in the ecosystem, where there are approximately 300,000 species of plants on the earth's surface, in addition to being a source of food for some organisms, and plants get the energy needed to grow and reproduce through photosynthesis.</font>
		<h2>Main plant parts </h2>
		<h1 id="Plants consist:"></h1>
			<p><font color="Darkgreen" size="6">Plants consist of 6 main parts, which are as follows:</font><br><font size="5">Root:</font> The main part of the plant that plays an important role in keeping the plant alive is by installing the plant well on the surface of the earth, absorbing water and minerals that provide food for the plant, and the primary store of carbohydrates and sugars, and the roots vary depending on the type of plant, some of which are superficial and do not reach the depths of the soil, and others grow vertically deep in the soil.<br>
				<font size="5">Leg:</font>The connecting part between the legs and roots, its function is to transport water and food to all parts of the plant, where wood tissue cells transport water, while bark cells transport food, the leg contributes to supporting the plant to stand vertically, and the leg has different types.<br>
				<font size="5">Leaves:</font> Is the part responsible for making food and carrying out the process of photosynthesis, where it absorbs the sunlight on it, uses carbon dioxide, water and chlorville to make glucose, and surrounds the paper an outer layer to protect it called skin.<br>
				<font size="5">Flower:</font> The part responsible for reproduction in plants and seed production.<br>
				<font size="5">Fruit:</font> Mature eggs containing seeds are called fruits, some of which are edible, such as cucumbers and tomatoes.<br>
				<font size="5">Seed:</font> Plant embryos, a means of reproduction and propagation, contain the germination part, which is responsible for storing food for seeds during growth </p>
