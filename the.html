	<p><font size="5" >  Plants are as essential to human existence as land, water, and air. Without plants, our day-to-day lives would be impossible because without oxygen from photosynthesis, aerobic life cannot be sustained. From providing food and shelter to serving as a source of medicines, oils, perfumes, and industrial products, plants provide humans with numerous valuable resources.</font></p>

	<p><font size="5">A poisonous plant is a type of plant that may cause humans and various animals, when fed with it, to cause disease symptoms accompanied by irritation, nervousness, malaise or skin sensitivity, which may result in various health consequences, which appear immediately or after a while, as a result of the accumulation of toxic substances in the tissues of the organism.  The toxicity of poisonous plants varies widely, some of them are very toxic, such as the blotched hemlock plant and the oleander plant, and some of them cause poisoning when feeding in a large amount of it or for a long time, such as the watercress plant</font></p>
	<p><font size="5">Poisonous plants spread in all places, as they are found in and around home gardens, on roadsides and outskirts of fields, and in pastures, forests, and others.  Because of its wide spread, the incidents of poisoning by it are not few. In most cases, plant poisoning is linked to specific conditions and factors. Knowing these conditions and factors enables many cases of poisoning by poisonous plants to be avoided.</font></p>
